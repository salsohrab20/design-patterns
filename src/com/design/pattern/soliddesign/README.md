SOLID -> 

S-> Single Responsibility Principle
    - class should have only one reason to change

O-> Open Closed Principle
    - Open for extension but closed for modification

L-> Liskov Substitution Principle
    - Subtype should be replaceable by base type

I-> Interface Segregation Principle
    - Many Specific interface are better than a single Interface

D-> Dependency Inversion Principle
    - We must depend on abstraction and not on Concrete classes
    - High level modules should not depend on low level modules but should depend on abstraction
